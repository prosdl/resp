1) Description
---------------
resp is  a chess program, which can be used with Tim Mann's excellent graphical
user interface WinBoard Ver.4.2.5 or higher (http://www.tim-mann.org/). 


2) Installation
----------------
Unzip the binaries to a directory, let's say c:\resp_directory and add the
following entry to the winboard.ini file:

      /fcp resp /fd "c:\resp_directory"
      /scp resp /sd "c:\resp_directory"

3) Usage
----------
You can set all necessary options in the 'resp.ini' file. Please look at the
comments in this file, to see how this can be done.

When you use resp in console mode, there are some commands, which you 
may find useful:

-createbook <pgnfile> <bookfile> <depth>

   Used to create opening books. An example:

   createbook games.pgn book.bin 20

   ... will use the PGN file "games.pgn" to create a resp opening book called
   book.bin. To use it there has to be the line Standard_Book_name=book.bin in
   your "resp.ini"! The 20 means: use the first 20 moves (halfply) from
   games.pgn.

-runepd [+] <filename> <time_in_secs> [ <position> ]

   Used to run EPD-test suites. <filename> is the name of the EPD-file,
   <time_in_secs> is the time per seconds resp will search a position.  You can
   use <position> to run the test only on a specific position in the EPD-file.
   If you use the "+" the results of the test will be added to a file called
   "results.unl". If you want to generate HTML tables with the test results you
   can use the simple perl-script res2html.pl by typing "res2html.pl
   results.unl" at the command line [1] (this makes sense if you run many tests
   with different configurations or different versions of resp on the same test
   suite, because the perl script will produce one table for each test;
   actually this option is very useful for the author, but probably not that
   useful for most others :-).

   [1] Of course you need a version of Perl installed on your system ;)

- sb "<file_name>"|<FEN_string>

  Use this command to set up a FEN position. If you want to load a position
  from a file use the quotes, like sb "test.fen".

4) Bugs
--------
If you find a bug you can send a report to p_rosendahl@t-online.de.  If
possible, please include the winboard.debug file in your email.

5) Thanks
----------
To everyone contributing to free chess software!

Many thanks to Robert Hyatt for allowing me to use an adaption of CheckInput()
for Windows from Crafty's utility.c.

Special thanks to Tim Mann for XBoard/WinBoard and Tom Kerrigan for TSCP (a
small chess engine written in C that is a great starting point, when you want
to develop your own chess engine). I learned a lot about chess programming by
looking into the sources of other authors; so thanks a lot to those programmers
who opened up their source code: Robert Hyatt (Crafty), Jon Dart (Arasan), Dan
Homan (EXchess), Gian-Carlo Pascutto (Sjeng), Adrien Regimbald (Faile), Colin
Frayn and Dann Corbit (Beowulf),  Colin Frayn (ColChess), Carlos del Cacho
(Pepito), Bruce Moreland (Gerbil) and many others ...  Also thanks to everyone
asking or answering questions at CCC (www.icdchess.com) or the WinBoard Forum
(http://f11.parsimony.net/forum16635/) and for those, who are running my engine
in tournaments, especially Leo Dijksman, Andreas Herrmann, George Lyapko and
Lars Hallerström.
